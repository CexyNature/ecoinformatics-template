## About .gitignore

Please notice that some common extensions associated to data files (e.g. `.csv`) are included in the `.gitignore` file. This was done on purpose as often you will not wish to copy your data to your repository, either because your dataset is larger than your repository hosting service will allow, or because data must be archived in specific data silos. If you want **git** to track data files, please be sure to add those files manually, or modify the `.gitignore` file.
